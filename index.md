## Hi there, I'm Anita!
I'm a fourth-year student at Oregon State University majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Statistics.
I'm currently most interested in learning more about machine learning, full stack development, and how to use
tech for social good.

I am an undergraduate researcher at OSU, mentored by [Dr. Minsuk Kahng](minsuk.com). Currently, my capstone team
and I are helping Dr. Kahng develop a novel video searching and browsing web application that leverages a deep 
learning model in order to service custom queries about TV shows. 

I am also a peer tutor for the College of Engineering and the Treasurer of the 
[Adaptive Technology Engineering Network](http://groups.engr.oregonstate.edu/aten/)
(ATEN) club. I have also helped to put together and host the 
[Leading and Enabling Adolescent Futures in STEM (LEAFS)](http://groups.engr.oregonstate.edu/aten/leafs/home)
Program at OSU in the winters of 2019 and 2020.

Beyond academics and extracurriculars, I have a little bit of industry experience from my internship at Google in 2019. 
As a Google Engineering Practicum intern, I worked on a web application for the 
[Network Planner team](https://www.google.com/get/spectrumdatabase/) 
that would allow users to upload CSVs and visualize geo-tagged data for the purposes of planning a shared spectrum ecosystem.

### Hobbies + Fun Stuff
When I'm not working or studying, I really enjoy reading, trying new teas, 
cooking and baking with and for my friends and family, and playing some (kind of dorky) 
video games (The Sims 3 or Flight Rising, anyone?). I have also dabbled in bookbinding 
and I took piano lessons for 12 years of my life, though I rarely have time to play nowadays.

### Up next on my bucketlist
* Learn how to train and deploy a machine learning model as a web app.
* Make Earl Grey ice cream.
* Complete a tour of all the chocolate shops in Portland.
* Create a web app to keep track of my Sims 3 family trees.
* Create a program to calculate the carbon footprint of a meal.
* Finish [The Broken Earth trilogy by N.K. Jemisin](https://www.goodreads.com/series/112296-the-broken-earth).
